          Instead of writing down complete sentences, summarise each topic using just a few important words. Without looking, quickly summarise each paragraph in one
          of your own words. Reduce or combine your list of summarised points to the number of points you can cover in the allotted word count.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a rough plan or draught, you could start out small by identifying only a few keywords or phrases. Alternatively, you could start out big by summarising
          every section, paragraph, and sentence in the original text until you have reduced it to its essential components.
        </p>
        <p>
          Try to use your notes or memories and keep as far away from the original as you can while creating your first plan or draught. You can review it later, but
          you need to put some distance between yourself and the information in order to form your own opinion and have faith in the details you have determined to be crucial.

            Are You Highly Confused About The Synopsis Writing Format & And Structure Of Synopsis?

          <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm md:text-base mb-4 text-justify">
            The secret to crafting a succinct summary that stays within your word restriction is to start from your own condensed notes rather than the considerably
            longer original text. If you go over the word limit, you can start removing words that donâ€™t seem necessary, but if you do so excessively, the text wonâ€™t
            read well or make sense. It could be preferable to eliminate entire clauses and perhaps even entire points rather than pick out a few words here and there.

            It takes talent to craft a strong synopsis, and there are several obstacles to overcome:
